# Stakeholder Report for CEO: Legacy Code Modernization Platform
**Generated by:** Static Code Analysis  
**Date:** 2026-02-01

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Legacy Code Modernization** platform is a strategic enabler designed to accelerate the migration of legacy Java applications to modern cloud-native architectures (Go). The current release is a **High-Fidelity Prototype** that demonstrates the end-to-end user journey, including analysis, planning, and automated refactoring.

**Verdict:** The system effectively visualizes the value proposition (automated architectural transformation) and is ready for client demos. The underlying engine is functioning in a simulated environment and requires integration to become a production-grade tool.

---

## 2. Product Overview
- **Value Proposition**: Reduces the risk and cost of legacy modernization by automating the discovery (`Analyzing`), planning (`Architecting`), and code generation (`Migrating`) phases.
- **Target Audience**: Enterprise Architects, CTOs, and Engineering Leads managing technical debt.
- **Experience**: A "Pilot Cockpit" interface that turns a complex manual process into a guided, visual automated workflow.

## 3. Feature Readiness Summary

| Feature Area | User Value | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Dashboard** | High-level visibility into modernization efforts. | **Ready** | Polished UI. |
| **Live Modernization** | Real-time visualization of the AI refactoring agent. | **Demo Ready** | Fully simulated flow. |
| **Architecture Maps** | Visual confirmation of the "Before" vs "After" state. | **Ready** | Premium Hexagonal/Strangler Fig diagrams. |
| **Code Inspection** | Trust-building by showing side-by-side code diffs. | **Ready** | Syntax-highlighted comparison. |
| **System Configuration** | Control over LLM providers and target architecture. | **In Progress** | UI is complete; settings are local-only. |

## 4. User Journeys
1.  **The "Discovery" Flow**:
    - User connects a legacy repository.
    - System ingests code and presents a **Dependency Graph** showing tight coupling.
2.  **The "modernization" Flow**:
    - User initiates a "Live Run".
    - Watch as Agents identify bounded contexts.
    - **Outcome**: A Hexagonal Architecture blueprint is generated.
3.  **The "Validation" Flow**:
    - User reviews the generated Microservice code.
    - System runs automated tests and validates endpoints.
    - **Outcome**: A "Ready to Deploy" symbol.

## 5. Roadmap & Readiness
**Current State**: Phase 1 (Interactive Demo). The platform is perfect for sales calls and stakeholder buy-in.

**30-Day Outlook (Phase 2)**:
- **Backend Integration**: Wiring the frontend to the existing backend API.
- **Real Ingestion**: Allowing users to upload their own ZIP files instead of using only sample data.
- **Persistent Settings**: Saving API keys and preferences.

**90-Day Outlook (Phase 3)**:
- **LLM Integration**: Replacing simulated "Agents" with actual LLM calls (OpenAI/Anthropic) to generate code dynamically.
- **Multi-Project Support**: Database integration to manage multiple client portfolios.

---

## 6. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: The demo relies on "Mock Data".
    - *Impact*: Users cannot test with their *own* code yet.
    - *Mitigation*: Prioritize Phase 2 (Real Ingestion) immediately.
- **Risk**: Security of API Keys.
    - *Impact*: Potential leak if not handled correctly.
    - *Mitigation*: Encryption at rest (AES-256) is planned; currently UI-only.

## 7. Resourcing
- **Required**: 1 Full Stack Engineer to complete the Backend Integration (Phase 2).
- **Required**: 1 AI/Backend Engineer to implement the LLM prompt pipeline (Phase 3).
